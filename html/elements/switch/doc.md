# Switch
Switches are a simple boolean selector. It can be useful to have many of these in a list for settings / permissions and other boolean controls. It's also worth looking at the [Checkbox Element](/html/elements/checkbox/checkbox.html) which functions the same but is displayed differently.

Switches should support tab indexing and highlighting for accessability.
