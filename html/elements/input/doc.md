# Inputs

Inputs are wrapped within a special parent which neatly aligns the input inside it, as well as additional content you may choose to place around it such as emoji's, icons or controls (e.g. clear button or view / hide input controls).

Inputs should support tab indexing and highlighting for accessability.
