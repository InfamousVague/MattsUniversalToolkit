# Progress Button

This component can be useful for reporting the progress of things such as downloads, updates and more. Because it's also a button it can easily be included in navigation components and take you to, for instance, the downloads page when pressed.

This component supports different bar colors through the standard highlights. You should apply these to the `svg` element's `class`.

**Success:** `svg success`

**Info:** `svg info`

**Warning:** `svg warning`

**Error:** `svg error`

Additionally you can change the inner button as you can with the standard `Button` element.
