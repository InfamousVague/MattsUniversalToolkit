# Coin Balance

I don't think much documentation is required for the coin balance at this stage other than a heads up that it supports highlighting. This is just a simple display which includes an icon of some coins and an integer. It could become more in the future, though.

## Highlights

**Success:** `highlight-success`

**Info:** `highlight-info`

**Warning:** `highlight-warning`

**Error:** `highlight-error`
