# Pin Entry

The Pin Entry component is inteded to be used for login or security input purposes.

It includes options to display a pin pad for entering digits into the pin input. 

Additionally applying the `data-shuffle="true"` attribute will change the position of the digits on each digit entered to prevent recording a video of someone entering their pin and estimating their pin by tracking their thumb positions on the screen of their device.

This component also supports tab indexing and highlighting for accessability.

Lastly, the component is designed in a way that password managers can still be used to autofill this input method.
