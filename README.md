<h4 align="center">Privacy First, Modular, P2P messaging client built atop Warp.</h4>

<br/>

Uplink is written in TS with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It is developed as a new foundation for implementing Warp features in a universal application.

The goal should be to build a hyper-customizable application that can run anywhere and support extensions.

## Get Testnet Bitcoin

1. Install Xverse Chrome extension (or Unisat)

2. In Xverse, go to Settings -> General -> Network and select 'Testnet'

3. Get some free Testnet BTC from a faucet. For example https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/send.php

## Get (Sepolia) Testnet Ethereum and LINK (ERC20 Token)

1. Install the MetaMask Chrome extension

2. In Metamask, Open the dropdown in the top left corner, and select Sepolia (This is the Ethereum test net currently)

3. Go to https://faucets.chain.link and select Sepolia ETH and LINK. Press continue and paste your address.

## Request a Payment

1. While chatting with another user in UplinkWeb, click the `Create Payment Request` button on the bottom chat bar (coin exchange icon, next to chat input).

2. Select the asset type. If selecting ETH.ERC20, you will need to put in the asset ID as well. The asset ID of LINK on Sepolia test net is `0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789` (You can see this ID in MetaMask if you own some LINK: click on it, then near the top click the '3 dots' icon, and select 'Token details'. The ID is listed under `Token contract address`).

3. In UplinkWeb, once you select the asset (and ID if applicable), enter an amount. Then click the `Request` button. A clickable message will appear in the chat. Anyone clicking this message will get a prompt via the Chrome extension to make the transfer. (Expect at least 10 seconds for a transfer to go through on the Ethereum network).
